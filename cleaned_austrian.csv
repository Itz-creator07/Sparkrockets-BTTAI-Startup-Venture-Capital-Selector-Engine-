aws Creative Impact,Austria,Grant,http://www.aws.at/en/aws-creative-impact/,200.0,"aws Creative Impact is one of Austria Wirtschaftsservice’s grant programs for startups and small businesses. But first, let’s define what Austria Wirtschaftsservice actually is:

Austria Wirtschaftsservice (aws) is the Austrian federal government’s development bank that supports companies in investing in innovative projects.

aws offers companies and startups various grants, they are:

(1) “soft loans” (low-interest loans)

(2) guarantees (to companies that need to apply for bank loans yet fail to do so as default risk is too high)

(3) repayable and non repayable grants (the latter being essentially free money)

Creative Impact is a grant program that aims to promote innovative new products and services. Therefore, the funding covers for expenses incurred for the development of prototypes and go-to-market strategy and implementation.

Successful applicants receive up to €200,000 non-repayable grant, to be be disbursed in 3 tranches over the life of the project (1 to 3 years max.) and which shall cover 50-70% of the eligible project costs.

Eligible project costs the grant can fund include:

Employees salaries
Material and equipment costs (e.g. intellectual property, machinery, tools, tech infrastructure, etc.)
Subcontractor fees directly involved in the project (e.g. market research, marketing & communication, coaching, etc.)
Overheads incurred as part of the project",aws.at/en/aws-creative-impact/
aws Growth,Austria,Grant,http://www.aws.at/en/aws-growth-investment/,400.0,"aws Growth investment (aws Wachstumsinvestition) is another of Austria’s top startup grants. It’s also another of aws’ grant programs that support innovation projects.

Yet, unlike Creative Impact, Growth investment is specifically aimed at projects that focus on strengthening a company’s market position.

Successful applicants receive on average anywhere between €300,000 to €400,000 non-repayable grant funding, to be disbursed in phases, over the life of the project (2 years maximum).

The type of costs eligible to be covered by the grant include: machinery, prototypes, technical equipment and other material and equipment investment.

The grant amounts to up to €200,000 and covers 100% of expenses incurred as part of the POC. Eligible expenses can be:

Any other expenses related to product development and market launch

Employees salaries and material and equipment costs related directly to the POC work",aws.at/en/aws-preseed/

To be eligible, your business must be considered deep tech and have less than 50 employees, and annual sales or balance sheet assets of mo more than €10 million.

The amount is significantly higher though: companies can indeed receive up to €800,000 over 1 to 2 years. Also, the grant must be repaid no later than 12 years later, which gives ample room for businesses to generate positive cash flows.",aws.at/en/aws-seedfinancing-deep-tech/

In simple terms, any eligible business can claim qualifying R&D expenses under the R&D tax credit scheme. In return, companies receive up to 30% of the amount claimed as a tax credit.

Also, any R&D expense that fall under either fundamental research, industrial research or experimental development can be claimed. Examples of such expenses include: salaries, subcontractor costs, overheads, etc.

What is it?
Tax credit of up to 30% of claimed R&D costs. The tax credit is then used to offset any corporate taxes in the future.

For whom?
The eligibility criteria for France’s R&D tax credit is very broad. Indeed, all types of businesses from any sector can be eligible as long as they invest in R&D.

Also, it doesn’t matter whether your business is loss-making or profitable. Indeed, even loss-making businesses can claim R&D expenses under the CIR tax program and carry forward any tax credit in the future. So as long as you spend in R&D, you can claim CIR.

IBB offers financial assistance to technology-oriented SMEs and startups in the early stages of their business operation.

Pro FIT (Frühphasenfinanzierung) is abnother of Germany’s top public grants that supports startups with financing in their first years. The grant covers expenses such as personnel costs, investment in material & equipment and other operating expenses.

Unlike non repayable grants, Pro FIT mostly funds projects with loans instead. Therefore, they need to be repaid. There are 2 phases to the Frühphasenfinanzierung grant:

Phase 1: 50% funded with a non-repayable grant and 50% with a loan. The phase must last no more than a year
Phase 2: 100% funded with a loan
Also, what’s great about Pro FIT is that businesses can finance 100% of their project costs with the grant. Yet, note the maximum that can be funded is €500,000 total per project.

In order to apply your business must:

Be a newly incorporated business: no more than 12 months ago (phase 1) or 24 months ago (phase 2)

In short, grants can be up to €400,000 and loans up to €1,000,000 per project. Yet, the grant doesn’t fund 100% of eligible expenses but 80% instead, so businesses must fund the remaining 20% themselves.",ibb.de/en/foerderprogramme/pro-fit-projektfinanzierung.html

Innovation Fund Serbia,Serbia,Grant,http://www.inovacionifond.rs/en/fond/about-fund,5000000.0,"Serbia is one of the first countries in the region to adopt the so-called innovation imperative – the idea that successful participation in the world economy based on knowledge implies the ability to adapt and improve technological and research capacities based on cooperation between the public and private sectors.

Active since 2011, the Innovation Fund has been a pioneer in the institutional implementation of this imperative - primarily by increasing the capacity of start-ups and available resources for their growth. The Fund is thus part of a broader state innovation strategy.

The vision of the Fund is to, as a key state actor in the development of Serbia's innovation system, contribute to the country's economic growth by supporting innovation, strengthening the link between science and economy, establishing new and strengthening existing companies with innovative potential, through various financial instruments.

The Fund's mission is to support the development of innovation through appropriate financial, technical and advisory support instruments to empower innovative enterprises and strengthen the link between research and development on the one hand and the business sector on the other, respecting the highest ethical, financial and business standards and practices.

The Fund aims to improve the links between science, technology and the economy and contribute to encouraging the development of innovative entrepreneurship by:

сupporting innovative entrepreneurship, especially in the early stages of development;
connecting scientific research organizations and private companies for the development and commercialization of innovations;
enabling new products, technologies and services to enter the market;
establishing long-term institutional support of the state for innovative entrepreneurship in cooperation with international financial institutions, organizations, donors and the private sector.
The European Union's support to the Fund, since the beginning of its operational work in 2011, has given a crucial impetus to the financing of innovation in Serbia and the strengthening of links between the research and private sectors. 

The Innovation Fund has established an independent management structure with a developed system of international project auditing and a reputable Expert Commission consisting of international and diaspora experts with many years of experience running technology companies, scientific research, commercialization and investment in innovation.

Results

By encouraging innovative entrepreneurship and strengthening the link between science and economy, the Innovation Fund, under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, with the wholehearted support of the European Union and the World Bank, will make great efforts to create a positive environment to support the economy based on knowledge.",inovacionifond.rs/en/fond/about-fund

Fostering the creation of economic activity based on the results of R&D projects and the introduction of products, processes and services in the market more quickly.
Promoting technological and business development and the internationalization of these companies.
Ensuring public financing of project participants.
For this reason, Eurostars is oriented towards the generation of R&D projects carried out by small consortia and led by innovative SMEs. Said projects must represent a break with the technical state of the art and a commercial challenge such that they allow these companies to make an important qualitative leap in their position in the market.

It is a centralized and independent evaluation program, managed by the Eureka Secretariat, and decentralized and coordinated financing, in which the partners of the approved projects receive the funds directly from their national financing body (the CDTI in the case of Spain, through the call Interempresas Internacional ).

EUROSTARS is articulated as follows:

The EUREKA Secretariat (ESE) is the executing agency of the Program
Projects are submitted for evaluation via the E!PMP platform: myeurekaproject.org/competition/search
The projects are approved by the HLG group of Eureka-Eurostars, through a single list ordered based on a centralized evaluation, carried out by a panel of independent experts (IEP).
Approved projects are funded in descending order, starting with the one with the highest score, as long as there are public funds available in all countries involved in a project.
Entities participating in EUROSTARS projects receive aid at the national level through their funding Agencies. The eligible costs and the requirements for their concession are defined in each country by said Agencies.
Eurostars is part of the European Partnership on Innovative SMEs. The partnership is co-funded by the European Union through Horizon Europe.

Spanish funding body, the Centre for the Development of Technology and Innovation (CDTI), funds R&D costs for SMEs participating in our Eurostars programme.

Spanish small companies can receive a grant covering up to 60% of the participant's eligible costs and Spanish medium-sized companies can receive a grant covering up to 50% of participant's eligible costs. If there is national budget available, the grant could be increased to up to 70% for all SMEs.

There is no maximum or minimum budget for Spanish participants, but the maximum funding amount is a grant of 400,000 euro per Spanish participant in a project.

Eligible costs for Spanish participants must be linked to industrial research or experimental development tasks:

Costs of the personnel performing R&D tasks, including up to 58 hours per month for project management
Overheads (up to 25% of personnel costs)

BRIDGE actually consists of two separate programs:

Proof of Concept – this grant is for newly grads who have made successful research work and are interested in developing practical applications or services based on their work. Innovations of all kinds from all research areas may be accepted by the grant officials.

Discovery – this grant is exclusively for scientists who have years of experience in their respective fields and are looking to explore the innovation potential of their research work and implement it on a commercial scale. OA review board will look into the submitted proposals and approve only those that have real social and economic impact.

BRIDGE Proof of Concept
Are you a newly graduate student with bachelor’s degree, or someone with a master of science degree? Do you have basic research experience, or an innovative idea that requires R&D to produce a marketable product? And are you looking for funding opportunities to supplant your idea for research? 

Then the BRIDGE Proof of Concept is just what you’re looking for.

BRIDGE Proof of Concept is a funding program designed to provide financial assistance to young researchers to turn their research data into practical products/services with high potential market value.

BRIDGE Discovery
If you’re an experienced researcher with a tested and proven innovative idea and you also need funding to develop it further into a product that will benefit humanity, then BRIDGE Discovery can help you.

R&D Tax Credit,United Kingdom,Tax Credit,http://www.ukri.org/opportunity/,,"The R&D tax credit scheme is a government tax incentive to promote UK businesses investing in innovation. R&D tax credits can either be paid back as cash, or reduce companies’ next tax bill.

In reality there are 2 separate tax credit schemes:

SME R&D Tax Credit scheme for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). Companies must have less than £100M revenue and 500 employees, or less than £86m in assets on their balance sheet to qualify
RDEC R&D Tax Credit scheme for large businesses
The tax benefits are slightly different for the 2 schemes. Luckily, the most attractive is the SME R&D Tax Credit. More importantly, the SME R&D Tax Credit is all the more attractive for loss-making businesses, which often is the case for early-stage startups.

Is Your Startup Eligible?
As long as your business is falling under the conditions cited above (£100M revenue and 500 employees, or less than £86m in assets), it is eligible. Good news – as virtually all startups are considered as SMEs from the standpoint of these criteria.

Although R&D tax credits can only be claimed against qualifying R&D expenses, there is no limitation on the sector or industry a business is in.

As long as you can justify the R&D expenses are only related to the qualifying research and development work, you can claim expenses such as: salaries, subcontractor expenses, utilities, hardware supplies and materials cost used in research (including capital expenditures) and software hosting and infrastructure costs.

How Much Can You Actually Get?
Startups and SMEs in general can claim up to 33% of their research and development costs in cash. The percentage depends on a number of factors.

Luckily though, most startups can claim the maximum (i.e. 33%) which can significantly reduce their cash burn, and eventually, improve their runway.

Moreover, not only do businesses get funding but they also can win big contracts with public institutions. Indeed, over £470 million worth of contracts have been funded through SBRI since the program’s creation in 2001.

What’s more is that the program primarily benefits SMEs over large companies. Indeed, more than 66% of the funding grants have been funded to SMEs to date.

Is Your Startup Eligible?
All types of industries are eligible. Indeed, applications can come from any tech-enabled company, no matter what sector(s) it applies to.

As long as your business demonstrates it is carrying an innovative project, which is also commercially viable and has a positive impact on the UK economy, you may be able to apply.

First, your business must be either a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise (SME) which is the case for all startups.

Also, the project(s) work need to be carried out in the UK. Same goes for the benefits of the project(s): they need to be commercially exploited “from or in the UK”.

Finally, the project need to meet certain duration and cost criteria:

Project(s) between 6 to 18 months must have a total cost between £25,000 and £500,000
Project(s) between 19 to 36 months must have a total cost between £25,000 and £2,000,000
